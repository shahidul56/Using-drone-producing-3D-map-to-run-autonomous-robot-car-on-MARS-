# Using-drone-producing-3D-map-to-run-autonomous-robot-car-on-MARS-
Solar powered drone will take the low lavel ground photography of the mars and our ai 3d anlalysing algorithm will analysis the image data and produce 3d map for the mars rover robot , so that the rover could take the map data and find the best clean way to go to a place on mars

It's been always difficult for the nasa's mars robot to find best way to go through as the full mars ground label is fill with small large and very sharp stone. At the same time nasa scientist and the engineer don't have the full sight view   as the cemera has 180 degree view capable. Again as satellite don't give very low ground label fotage so controller of the mars robot have no idea what is ahead or infornt of the robot. Some time for not to find the best way mars robot got into the sharp stone way that break the rover's wheel.
